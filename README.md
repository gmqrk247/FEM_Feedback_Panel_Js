# FEM_Feedback_Panel_Js
Frontend mentor feedback panel challenge with javascript

I had to try really hard to finish this one. Javascript is still new to me and it is often not as easy to see clearly how a problem can be solved. I googled a lot to find solutions and ways and luckily, I was able to come up with one. Perhaps it is not the best or most efficient one, but it is one and I did it on my own ( with research ofc ).
